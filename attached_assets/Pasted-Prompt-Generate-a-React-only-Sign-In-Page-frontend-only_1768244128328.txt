Prompt — Generate a React-only Sign-In Page (frontend only)

Use this exact prompt with a code generator or hand to a front-end dev to produce a single, production-quality React sign-in page that matches the supplied design (Smart Crop Prediction System). Frontend only — no backend, no Firebase integration. Provide code, styles, and assets references. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Goal
Create a responsive, accessible, modern sign-in page for a web app called “Smart Crop Prediction System”. The screen is two vertical sections: a green left informational/branding area and a white right sign-in card. Match the layout, colors, spacing, and visual details described below.

High-level requirements

React (v17 or v18) — functional components + hooks.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (configured and used throughout).

Single page (Sign In). No backend calls — simulate (e.g., show success toast on submit).

Provide file structure and individual component files.

Include a small set of placeholder assets: left illustration (/assets/farm-illustration.png) and Google logo (/assets/google.svg) — if generator can fetch, use a 3D farm illustration; otherwise use placeholders.

Accessibility: proper label elements, aria-* where relevant, keyboard navigation and visible focus rings.

Responsive: left panel collapses or stacks above on narrow screens; form remains centered and usable on mobile.

Deliverables: full React source (components, App.js, index.css instructions for Tailwind), and instructions to run.

Visual / UI details (strict)
Left panel (branding):

Width: ~50% on desktop, hidden or stacked on mobile.

Background: green gradient left → center. Suggested hexs: #0fb06b (dark) → #3bd18b (lighter).

Big heading: “Smart Crop Prediction System” (large, bold; two lines). Font: Poppins/Inter (system fallback).

Subtitle: “Empowering Sri Lankan farmers with data-driven agricultural predictions.” (smaller, white).

Illustration: 3D farmer + red barn + crops placed bottom-left. Use /assets/farm-illustration.png.

Center divider:

Soft vertical gradient line/fade between sections; subtle rounded inner left card corner.

Right panel (sign-in card):

Card: white background, rounded-2xl (2xl radius), thin neutral border, soft shadow.

Card width: max 440px (desktop). Padding roomy: p-8 to p-10.

Title: “Sign In” (bold, large).

Inputs:

Username or Email input:

Rounded input with subtle inset shadow, very light pink background #fbefef or #f7e6e6.

Left icon: user silhouette (inline SVG or lucide icon).

Border accent: subtle dual-tone outline (blue left accent + red right accent) — can be simulated using box-shadow or pseudo-element border gradient.

Placeholder text: “Username or Email”

Password input:

Same style with lock icon.

Both inputs should have label text that is visually hidden for a11y but present for screen readers.

Remember / Forgot:

Row with checkbox left (label: “Remember Me”) and a “Forgot Password?” link aligned right.

Buttons:

Primary Sign In button: large, rounded; soft fill with subtle border (or gradient border like design). Hover changes fill/tint.

Google Sign In button: outlined with Google logo on left and text “Sign in with Google”. Use /assets/google.svg. No OAuth — just UI click triggers a demo flow (toast).

Bottom link:

“New Here? Create an Account” with Create an Account emphasized and clickable.

Interaction & behavior

Simple front-end validation:

Email/username: required (if contains @ then validate email format).

Password: required, min length 6.

Show inline error messages under inputs (red text).

Form submit:

If validation passes, show a success toast or in-page success message (no navigation).

If validation fails, focus first invalid field.

Google button:

On click show a modal/alert: “(UI only) Google Sign-in clicked”.

Keyboard: pressing Enter in password field submits.

Focus states: visible ring (Tailwind focus:ring).

Accessibility

Inputs associated with label elements.

aria-invalid and aria-describedby used for errors.

Buttons have aria-pressed/aria-label if needed.

Logical tab order.

Responsive

Desktop: left 50% branding, right sign-in card centered vertically.

Tablet: maybe 40/60 split; keep card visible.

Mobile (<= 640px): left panel stacked above or hidden; card fills width with side padding.

Styling details

Tailwind utilities only. Provide brief tailwind config instructions:

tailwind.config.js content paths: ./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}.

Include base, components, utilities in index.css.

Suggested colors:

Green gradient: #0fb06b → #3bd18b.

Input background: #fbefef (light rose).

Accent borders: blue #3147ff and red #ff3b5c.

Card border: rgba(0,0,0,0.06).

Use rounded-2xl, shadow-lg, max-w-md, p-8.
